% Do you want a list of figures?
% Do you want a list of tables?
% Do you want an acknowledgement page?
% Do you want a list of acronyms?
\setboolean{list_of_figures}{true} % false or true - Default is true
\setboolean{list_of_tables}{true} % false or true - Default is false
\setboolean{acknowledgement}{false} % false or true - Default is true
\setboolean{acronyms}{true} % false or true - Default is true
\setboolean{symbols}{true} % false or true - Default is true

% If you want to print your thesis, consider changing the command below to true. If true, the command adds labels at the edge of the pages which will make easy to identify a chapter running through the pages with the finger. It is just a visual setting. The default values are different for MENG/BEng and MSc as a consequence of the different approval process. In any case, you can change this to either true or false as you prefer.

\setboolean{edge_labels}{true} % default is true 

%The preferred spacing for FYP/MSc reports is doublespacing. This is because it is easier for markers to annotate the document while marking. Some students require the implementation of the singlespacing option. This can be activated below by changing from true to false, but discuss this with your supervisor first.
\setboolean{double_spacing}{true} %Default is true. If you want to change this, ask your supervisor if they are OK with singlespacing.

%%%%%%%%%%% PART B %%%%%%%%%%% 
% Is this an interim report or final report?
\setboolean{final_thesis}{true} % true for final Thesis / false for interim report
%\secondmarker{Second Marker\\[2mm]{\large \textsc Dr Jane Doe}} %If you do not know who your second marker is, use \secondmarker{}
